# Apple Fan v1
This project is an ESP32 based Apple II card the provides a temperature controlled fan in tandem with Home Assistant.  Will also function as a standalone unit if Home Assistan is not available.

Currently this is in a prototype phase and will soon be boarded up for testing.

Variables supplied to Home Assistant include internal temperature, humidity and fan rpm.  In HA a reset button is also included.
